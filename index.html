          AEROSPEC 100 is trusted by Aerospace & Defense engineers across the
          world due to its performance and reliability. It is lithium soap based
          semi-fluid low <span id="dots4">....</span> <span id="more4"> temperature aerospace grease containing synthetic
          di-ester base oil. The high lubricity of this premium performance
          grease increases heat dissipation and reduces operating temperatures,
          therefore extending component life and improving reliability.
          AEROSPEC 100 low temperature aerospace grease is specifically designed
          for the lubrication of rotary actuators and compact high performance
          gear boxes operating at low temperatures.</span> <button onclick="myFunction('dots4','more4','myBtn4')" id="myBtn4" class="btn-rm">Read More</button>

          Premium quality, chlorine free, EP, water mix cutting fluid designed
          to be used as part of the ROCOL TRI-Logic system. Formulated from a
          unique blend of specially<span id="dots5">....</span> <span id="more5"> selected additives to maximize in-sump life.
          Designed for heavy duty machining operations on a wide variety of
          metals such as steel, stainless steel, aluminum and its alloys. The
          combination of lubricity and extreme pressure additives
          in TRI-Logic HPX prevents built-up edge, extend tool life and promote
          excellent surface finish. The TRI-Logic system is a revolutionary
          approach to maximizing cutting fluid sump life, minimizing fluid
          disposal and reducing costs. For optimum performance, the TRI-Logic
          cutting fluids should be used with TRI-Logic VG68 sideway oil and,
          where applicable, TRI-Logic RTD tapping fluid.</span><button onclick="myFunction('dots5','more5','myBtn5')" id="myBtn5" class="btn-rm">Read More</button>

          Premium quality oil specifically designed for use in the hydraulic
          systems of machine tools. Designed to resist the <span id="dots6">....</span> <span id="more6">  tendency to generate
          deposits, sludge and varnish so giving increased service life and
          extended oil change intervals. The unique formulation of TRI-Logic®
          HO32 (World patent rights pending) minimizes the detrimental effects
          on cutting fluid emulsions usually associated with hydraulic oil
          leaks. Rather than acting as a food source for bacteria and fungi,
          therefore promoting growth, TRI-Logic® HO32 resists degradation.
          The TRI-Logic® system is a revolutionary approach to maximizing
          cutting fluid sump life, minimizing fluid disposal and reducing costs.
          For optimum performance, TRI-Logic® HO32 hydraulic oil should be used
          as part of the TRI-Logic® system. </span> <button onclick="myFunction('dots6','more6','myBtn6')" id="myBtn6" class="btn-rm">Read More</button>
